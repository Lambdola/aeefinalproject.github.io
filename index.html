                            <p>The Department of Agricultural and Environmental Engmeering (previously known as Agricultural Engineering) is one of the four foundational departments established when the former Institute of Applied Science and Technology acquired Faculty Status in 1975.<br><br>
                                Prior to this, elements which now form the Department were operating within the Institute. The degree of B.Sc. Agricultural Engineering was among the approved degree programmes for the Institute at its commencement in 1972. The first set of graduands passed out in June 1976.<br><br>
                                The Department now offers B.Sc. degree in Agricultural and Environmental Engineering at the undergraduate level and also runs approved Postgraduate programmes up to Ph.D. level. This programme helps prepare students for careers involving the application of engineering principles to agricultural production, food processing and storage, agricultural structures, conservation of land and water resources, and the environment.
